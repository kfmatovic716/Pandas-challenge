PyCitySchools analyzes the district-wide standardized test results. Data consists of Math and Reading scores of each student from District and Charter schools. 

Trends in School Performance:

1. Based on overall passing rates and average Math and Reading scores, Charter schools outperform the District schools. This is a clear explanation on why the top 5 perfoming schools are coming from Charter schools and the bottom 5 performing schools are from District schools.

2. "Scores by School Size" table shows poor average scores in large-sized school population and better average scores in small school population. The student performance is better in schools with smaller groups of students because the teacher to student ratio is smaller and the teacher is able to focus on each student's needs compared to a much bigger school population, where the ratio can be higher and not all students will be attended to.  

3. An increase in school budget per student does not contribute to the improvement in student perfomance. Based on the results in "Scores by School Spending," it illustrates that as the budget for each student increases, the overall average scores decreases.
